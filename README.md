### Documentation of some of New American Public Art's recent interactive art projects ###

** Different representations of the cubes **

 # hand sketches of stacks of cubes on paper and whiteboard
 # 3D CAD model of cubes
 # parts of 3D model converted to .STL file for 3D printing of sensor brackets
 # renderings from 3D model for presentations
 # rough Python model of interactive color changing with Pygame
 # more complicated Javascript demo of interaction with P5.js
 # C++ code to implement interaction (color changing, reading sensors) on microcontroller
 # Binary machine code file loaded onto microcontroller
 # Color gradient created in Photoshop, saved as PNG file
 # Python script reads color gradient; writes C++ code that contains color gradient data
 # Color data encoded as DMX512 packets for broadcast to lights
 # For wireless transmission, DMX512 encoded, then decoded, as frequency bursts. Different frequencies for each tower.
 # Bill of materials, saved as .CSV file
 # All the code is also hosted on Github, which shows changes made as code was developed
