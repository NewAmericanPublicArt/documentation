### Documentation of some of New American Public Art's recent interactive art projects ###

**Different representations of the cubes**

1. Hand sketches of stacks of cubes on paper and whiteboard
2. 3D CAD model of cubes
3. Parts of 3D model converted to .STL file for 3D printing of sensor brackets
4. Renderings from 3D model for presentations
5. Rough Python model of interactive color changing with Pygame
6. More complicated Javascript demo of interaction with P5.js
7. C++ code to implement interaction (color changing, reading sensors) on microcontroller
8. Binary machine code file loaded onto microcontroller
9. Color gradient created in Photoshop, saved as PNG file
10. Python script reads color gradient; writes C++ code that contains color gradient data
11. Color data encoded as DMX512 packets for broadcast to lights
12. For wireless transmission, DMX512 encoded, then decoded, as frequency bursts. Different frequencies for each tower.
13. Bill of materials, saved as .CSV file
14. All the code is also hosted on Github, which shows changes made as code was developed
15. Eventually, photos
16. Eventually, videos
17. Slow-motion video of lights for debugging fast lighting effects
18. Physical prototype: lights clamped to beam on wall; brain on desk
19. Event log streamed out USB port of microcontroller to verify behavior
20. Event log pasted into Excel to create charts of color change dynamics
