Blue Hour was originally designed for a 3 month installation in Camden, New Jersey, USA, in January of 2014. The work was inspired by the Kubik series of installations by Balestra Berlin. Blue Hour used NeoPixel LED strips wrapped around PVC cylinders to light up towers of IBC totes. The lights in the upper totes were just spotlights set to blue. The bottom tote of each tower contained LED strips that started blue, but when PIR sensors were triggered by a person nearby, they changed to orange. After the person left, the cube faded back to blue. The LED strips were controlled by an Arduino mounted under the cap of each bottom tote.
