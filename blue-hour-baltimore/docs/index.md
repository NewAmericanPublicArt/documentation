Blue Hour was originally designed for an installation in Camden, New Jersey, USA, in January of 2014. The piece used NeoPixel LED strips wrapped around PVC cylinders to light up towers of IBC totes. The lights in the upper totes were just spotlights set to blue. The LED strips started blue, but when PIR sensors were triggered, they changed to orange.
