# Towers #

We built the 6 towers of Blue Hour Baltimore out of "intermediate bulk containers" or "IBC totes." We bought a few totes for testing at Greg's barn in Maine, but most of the totes were bought in Maryland and delivered directly to the installation site. We held the totes together with hose clamps. The bottom tote was partially filled with water so drunk people couldn't tip the towers into the harbor. The top tote had an additional aluminum pallet attached to it; this housed the sensors and brain.

# Benches #

Each tower was surrounded by a bench on 4 sides. Greg built the benches out of 2x12 (or 2x10?) pine, then sanded and coated with something polyurethane. The benchtops were supported by welded steel frames.

# Electronics enclosure #

The electronics were enclosed in a polycarbonate box.
